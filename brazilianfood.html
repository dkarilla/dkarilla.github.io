    <h2>Brazilian Food</h2>
 
    	<p>As a dual citizen of Brazil, I was raised around many Brazilian customs and traditions. I have traveled around Brazil with my mother since childhood. I have been Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Brasilia and many rural areas. Unfortunately, I am not fluent in Portuguese, the national language of Brazil. I hope to spend more time in Brazil following the completion of my education and immerse myself in the language and culture until I can speak Portuguese like a native. </p>

	<p>My favorite part of Brazilian culture is the cuisine. I grew up eating rice and beans for dinner every day. I still make rice and beans pretty frequently even now that I live away from home. Rice and beans are two very large staples in the Brazilian diet; however, the cuisine offered around Brazil is still diverse. According to <a href="http://www.brazil.org.za/brazil-cuisine.html#.Up1LJZNetmE" target="_blank">Brazil.org</a>, the various types of dishes and ingredients used in Brazil are based largely on geographical location.  </p>
   
	<p>Fruits are that grow in tropical or sub-tropical climates are especially common in Brazil. I remember climbing mango trees when I was younger. My mother would grow papaya and guava on our family farm. Passion fruit, pineapple, oranges and the lesser-known jabuticaba are all also very common fruits and are used to make fresh juices or desserts.  </p>
	<p>According to a <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Cuisine_of_Brazil.html" target="_blank">Princeton website</a>, the Europeans immigrants from Portugal, Germany and Italy introduced wine, leaf vegetables and dairy products into Brazilian cuisine. Root vegetables are used often. For example, yucca or manioc is a popular root vegetable and yucca flour serves as the basis for many breads or baked good, including a type of cheese biscuit called pão de queijo. When the potatoes were not available to immigrants, they substituted with the native root manioc.</p>

	<p>Brazilians do not have a lot of appetizers because of how filling rice and beans can be as a main course. There is a lot of street food sold by vendors or in small stores. Coxinha, a fried food filled with shredded chicken, is my personal favorite. Coxinha is more common in Southeast Brazil, where my mother is from. Bolinhos are also popular and are deep-fried balls made of rice-based batter. </p>
    <p>As stated on <a href="http://www.gourmet.com/food/gourmetlive/2012/091912/regional-brazilian-cuisine" target="_blank">gourmet.com</a>, foods that come directly from northern Brazil include the acai berry and peppers. Acai has become popular in the United States, largely considered a “superfood” that is being used in many smoothie and yogurt recipes. The chili peppers used to create pimenta, or hot sauce, grow in northern Brazil.</p>
	<p>Some miscellaneous Brazilian foods include requejão, a type of cream cheese served at breakfast or as a snack. Romeo e Julieta is a bizarre flavor combination made up of a slice of cheese and a slice of guava paste. Brazilians do tend to drink a lot of fruit juice; however, one of their signature beverages is Guaraná, a soda made from the Brazilian fruit of the same name. </p>
