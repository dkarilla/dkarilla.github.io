    <h2>Brazilian Food</h2>
 
    	<p>As a dual citizen of Brazil, I was raised around many Brazilian customs and traditions. I have traveled around Brazil with my mother since childhood. I have been Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Brasilia and many rural areas. Unfortunately, I am not fluent in Portuguese, the national language of Brazil. I hope to spend more time in Brazil following the completion of my education and immerse myself in the language and culture until I can speak Portuguese like a native. </p>
	<p>My favorite part of Brazilian culture is the cuisine. I grew up eating rice and beans for dinner every day. I still make rice and beans pretty frequently even now that I live away from home. Rice and beans are two very large staples in the Brazilian diet; however, the cuisine offered around Brazil is still diverse. According to Brazil.org, the various types of dishes and ingredients used in Brazil are based largely on geographical location. </p>
	<p>Fruits are that grow in tropical or sub-tropical climates are especially common in Brazil. I remember climbing mango trees when I was younger. My mother would grow papaya and guava on our family farm. Passion fruit, pineapple, oranges and the lesser-known jabuticaba are all also very common fruits and are used to make fresh juices or desserts. </p>
	<p>As for vegetables, root vegetables are used often. For example, yucca is a popular root vegetable and yucca flour serves as the basis for many breads or baked good, including a type of cheese biscuit called pão de queijo.</p> 
	<p>Brazilians do not have a lot of appetizers because of how filling rice and beans can be as a main course. There is a lot of street food sold by vendors or in small stores. Coxinha, a fried food filled with shredded chicken, is my personal favorite. Bolinhos are also popular and are deep-friend balls made of rice-based batter.</p>
