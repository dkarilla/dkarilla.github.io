    <h2>Interview</h2>

 <p>
This is an interview with UF professor Welson Tremura, a native of Brazil who teaches in the UF School of Music. According to the UF College of Fine Arts website, Tremura is well versed in Brazilian Jazz, classical and vocal music and specializes in ethnomusicology. I chose to Tremura because he is from Brazil and has done extensive research on Brazilian culture for his field. I interviewed him primarily about his knowledge, opinions and experiences with Brazilian cuisine.

   <p> <strong>Q:</strong> My mom is from Southern Brazil, so I know that is drastically different from the North in the Amazon.</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The Amazon itself, it’s a whole different kind of set up, the relationships over there. Even a Brazilian would not understand that. You would have to be brought up in that region to understand the dynamics. You know how they think and you share a lot of common cultural traits, but you don’t necessarily do things in the same way or react to things in the same way.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> I grew up eating rice and beans every day. Would you say that changes from region to region in Brazil or is that pretty universal in Brazil? </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> It is pretty universal in Brazil I would say. I don’t think it has to do with the region. It has to do with the content of the food, which is fulfilling. [Rice and beans] fills your stomach in a sense I think. And the way that rice and beans mixes with other components or side dishes is different from region to region. In Brazil, the difference would be that some places have black beans and some places have pinto beans. There is all kinds of types of beans in Brazil as well. The flavor is very different from place to place, not only the type of food, but also how they cook the food and season it to taste a certain way. </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> You mentioned that rice and beans is filling. Why would that be important to Brazilians? </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I think it’s not important to Brazilians. I think it is important to fell fulfilled in a sense. Most people fell fulfilled in this culture when they eat mashed potatoes. In fact, I think they way you make the rice and beans gives a more diverse taste to the food than in most places. </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How do you make your rice and beans? </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> To be honest, I used to cook rice especially in the past. I used to cook with lime and garlic, a little bit of onion and salt. It is not so much the flavor as how you actually make it. I think the flavor of food is not actually what you put in it, but how you make it. </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are some misconceptions that associated with Brazilian food as culture? </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I think there is a danger in imagery in general. When you talk about people or culture, you tend to have an idea in your mind of how people behave and what people like. I’m not sure there is one element. The most common mistake is that people speak Spanish in Brazil. For Brazilians, Spanish is as foreign as German is to English. Also, that Brazilians all behave in the same manner. I think that culture and food are all linked to the region where you grew up and what kind of experience you had in your childhood. </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are other staples in the Brazilian diet? </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I think what is universal is pizza. In general, Brazilians like beef. The churrascaria, most Brazilains embrace that as international. You can go anywhere in Brazil, you’re going to find a steakhouse with beef made the way Argentinians make it. Also there is the farofa, you know, the shredded manioc with other ingredients that are every common. Brazilians also drink a lot of fresh juice. </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you think a lot of Brazilian food has made it to the U.S.? Why or why not? </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I think a lot of Brazilian food has made it to the U.S. Hysterically with coffee first. Brazil used to export coffee. If we’re talking about the U.S. specifically, Brazil exports a lot of oranges. The citrus industry in Brazil is still very strong because of the weather. </p>
