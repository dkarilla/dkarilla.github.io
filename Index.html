            <h2>About Karilla Dyer</h2>
            <p>I am a third-year public relations major at the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications. I consider myself an enthusiastic, hard working young woman who excels in social media management, research and planning. My strengths are my responsibility, integrity and positivity.</p>
            <p>I am a dual citizen of Brazil and was raised to be a world traveler. I have a passion for learning about other cultures and am advocate for diversity.  I have a love of teaching and mentoring. I have helped guide freshman first-generation students through college as a First Year Florida peer leader. I have also taught a listening and speaking course for students learning English at the University of Florida English Language Institute. I blog about film and write fiction stories in my free time. </p>
            <p>I plan to pursue a masterâ€™s degree in management at the University of Florida following the completion of my undergraduate career. I hope to start my public relations career as a press secretary before transitioning into the corporate world. </p>
